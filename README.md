Pandas_gdq/MySQL/google.cloud.storage
Hi there,
If you got into a situation which require loading SQL tqable to GCP BigQuery but there are some issues with google.cloud.bigquery library
Like i have - present to you Pandas_gdq which makes loading into GCP easier and without troubles.
Unfortanately, my connection was directed to MySQL localhost and without using SSH tunels, nevertheless loading into Big QUery and GCP buckets is standard 
Hope my solution will help to someone someday

Have a nice day, and don't stop searching if u find this solution but it's not suitable for your situation)
